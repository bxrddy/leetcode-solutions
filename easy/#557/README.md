# 557.Reverse Words in a String III

## Intuition
When I first saw the problem, it felt a bit like playing with words in a sentence. I mean, flipping each word while keeping the sentence's structure? It's like reading each word in a mirror but keeping the sentence normal.

## Approach
Okay, here's the breakdown:
1. Split the sentence into individual words. This gives us a list of words to work with.
2. For each word in the list, reverse it. It's like reading it backward.
3. Stitch these flipped words back together into a sentence. Just like putting puzzle pieces back together, but here the pieces are words.

And voil√†! We've got our sentence with each word reversed, but the overall structure is just as it was.
